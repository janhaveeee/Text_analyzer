# Text_analyzer

 AI-Powered Text Processing & Analysis Suite
 A cutting-edge AI-powered toolkit for text summarization, keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, topic classification, paraphrasing, readability scoring, question generation, and evaluation using ROUGE metrics.


Project Overview
This project leverages state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to analyze and process textual data efficiently. It includes multiple functionalities such as text summarization, keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, topic classification, paraphrasing, readability scoring, question generation, and evaluation with ROUGE metrics to enhance text understanding and refinement.

Features & Capabilities

1️⃣ Text Summarization 
Uses Pegasus (google/pegasus-large) to generate concise, high-quality summaries of long texts.
Avoids repetition and ensures the summary remains coherent and informative.

2️⃣ Keyword Extraction 
Uses YAKE (Yet Another Keyword Extractor) to extract the most important keywords from a given text.
Helps identify key topics and main themes.

3️⃣ Sentiment Analysis
Uses TextBlob to analyze the sentiment of the text.
Categorizes sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on polarity scores.

4️⃣ Topic Classification 
Uses Facebook's BART-Large MNLI for zero-shot topic classification.
Classifies text into Technology, Health, Finance, Education, Entertainment, Politics, and Sports.

5️⃣ Paraphrasing 
Uses T5-Small to rewrite text while maintaining its original meaning.
Generates alternative versions of the same sentence with improved readability.

6️⃣ Readability Scoring 
Uses TextStat to calculate the Flesch Reading Ease Score.
Determines how easy or difficult the text is to read.

7️⃣ Question Generation 
Uses T5-Large to generate meaningful questions based on input text.
Helps create quiz questions or content for educational purposes.

8️⃣ ROUGE Score Evaluation 
Uses ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) to measure summary accuracy.
Provides Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for evaluation.

9️⃣ Topic Visualization 
Uses Matplotlib to visualize topic classification results as a pie chart.
